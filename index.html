					<p>
						Hello, my name is Zakeena. I’m from India but I’ve lived in the UAE, India and now France. I love beaches and warm weather so I’m always looking forward to summer. I love spending time with my friends, whether it’s staying in doing little bonding activities or exploring the city. I’m not a morning person at all, so you’ll catch me being most active at night. I love exploring and late night walks but if it’s raining. don’t call me.</p>

				<h2><strong>Cooking</strong></h2>
					<p>I love experimenting with cooking. As a college student, it’s really difficult to have the time and budget so I have to get creative. I enjoy figuring out ways to maximize the use of my ingredients and recreating recipes I like from restaurants. I assure you, it’s not that hard to make the exact version. However, I’ll admit that the worst part is doing the dishes.</p>

				<h2><strong>Thrifting</strong></h2>
					<p>
						I love second hand clothing shopping. It’s one of the activities that I actually enjoy doing individually. I make a plan for the day, to go to an area in Paris to thrift clothes. Currently I’m trying to find new locations to explore, I don’t mind doing it with friends but I prefer doing it on my own because I can be there for hours without any judgement. I also have plans to rework clothes and customize them by using my basic stitching skills.

				<h2><strong>Watching Movies</strong></h2>
					<p>Watching movies with friends is something I also really enjoy. It’s really interesting to explore cultures and different tastes through movies. You also tend to find out a lot about your friends this way. Who likes scary movies, who is more into movies based off books etc. Also, it’s a great way to create cute memories on a budget, all it requires is a screen and some snacks.</p>
